### Project Title 
United States Bikeshare Data 

### Description

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. Thanks to the rise in information technologies which provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.


In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three cities in the United States : Chicago, New York City and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I had also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

So for making this project alive, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

About datasets, I used data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities.

I learned about bike share used in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.
First of all, user had to choose the city, the month and the day that he wanted to see information from. According to the information provided by the user, I wrote code to provide the following statistics:


#1 The Popular times of travel

It was about to provide the following information: The most common month, the  most common day of week and the most common hour of day.

#2 Popular stations and trip

It was about to provide the following information: The most common start station, the most common end station and the most common trip from start to end.

#3 Trip duration

It was about to provide the following information: The total travel time and the average travel time.


#4 User info

It was about to provide the following information: counts of each user type, counts of each gender, the most recent and most common year of birth.


So,after providing those statistics, I wrote code to ask user if he want to display the first 5 rows of data. If the answer is " yes ", then informations are displayed, but if the answer is " no ", I asked him if he want to restart. If the answer is "yes" then the program will be restarted but if the answer is " no " then he left the program.
